### Game Rules

Simply get the character to the other side of the incredibly treacherous terrain. Once
you reach the water, you are taken back to your starting position and are free to start again.
Your score increases on every safe arrival to the water, so test yourself and see how many
you can get!

### Controls
The keyboard arrows move the character. This is all you need!
