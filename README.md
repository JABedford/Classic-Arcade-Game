How to Play
-----------
### Game Rules

Simply get the character to the other side of the incredibly treacherous terrain. Once
you reach the water, you are taken back to your starting position and are free to start again.
Your score increases on every safe arrival to the water, so test yourself and see how many
you can get!

### Controls
The keyboard arrows move the character. This is all you need!
(Currently this game is not playable on touch devices.)

Coming Soon
----------
There are more features I would like to create to add to these game. Unfortunately times disallows this from happening, and I need to submit this project within the time frame of the scholarship. I am definitely going to revisit this game though and add more features:
* A Global Leaderboard - Users can submit their score and initials.
* Character Selection - Users can select their character at the start of the game.
* Extra Lives
* Rework the method of powering the bugs - These at the moment all run at the same time so it is possible to work out a rythym. I want to randomize the bugs movement.
